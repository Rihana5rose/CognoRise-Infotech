## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing salary distributions across various job roles, experience levels, employment types, and company sizes. By leveraging **Excel** and **Power Query**, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can guide career decisions and salary benchmarking.

### Tools Used:
- **Excel**: For data analysis and visualization
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning, transformation, and automation of repetitive tasks
- **Pivot Tables**: To summarize and analyze the data
- **Bar Charts**: To visualize the results and salary trends

</p>

### 1. Data Collection & Preparation
The dataset includes information such as:
- Job Titles
- Experience Levels (e.g., Entry, Mid, Senior)
- Employment Types (e.g., Full-time, Part-time, Contract)
- Salary in USD
- Company Size (Small, Medium, Large)
- Company Location and Employee Residence
- Work Year and Remote Ratio

The data was collected from multiple sources and cleaned to ensure consistency. **Power Query** was used to automate data cleaning and transformation steps.

### 2. Data Cleaning
In this step:
- **Removed duplicates** to avoid redundancy
- **Handled missing values** by either imputing them or removing incomplete records
- **Standardized data formats** (e.g., currency, dates) to ensure uniform analysis

### 3. Data Transformation
The raw dataset was transformed into a structured format suitable for analysis. Key steps included:
- **Converting salary values to a uniform currency (USD)**
- **Splitting fields** such as location into separate columns for more granular analysis
- **Adding calculated fields** to identify additional insights like the percentage of remote work

### 4. Data Analysis
Using **Excel Pivot Tables**, the following analyses were performed:
- **Salary Distribution by Job Title**: Analyzed the average and median salaries across different job roles.
- **Experience Level Impact**: Explored how salary changes with increasing experience (Entry, Mid, Senior).
- **Company Size & Salary**: Investigated the correlation between company size (Small, Medium, Large) and the salary offered.
- **Remote Work & Salary**: Assessed how remote work affects salary levels for various job roles.
- **Employment Type Salary Differences**: Compared full-time, part-time, and contract roles in terms of salary.

### 5. Data Visualization
A **dynamic dashboard** was created to visualize the key insights:
- **Bar charts** for salary comparisons across job roles and experience levels
- **Pie charts** to illustrate salary distribution by employment type
- **Slicers** for interactive filtering by job title, company size, and remote ratio
- **Scroll bar** for viewing specific data points interactively.

### 6. Insights & Key Findings
Some of the important insights derived from the analysis include:
- **Mid-level professionals** tend to earn higher salaries than entry-level and even some senior-level roles, depending on the job title.
- **Remote work** is generally associated with higher salaries in certain roles, though the effect varies by region.
- **Full-time employment** offers the highest salary packages compared to part-time and contract positions.
- **Large companies** tend to offer higher salaries, but some small companies offer competitive salaries for specialized roles.

## Future Scope
To further enhance this project:
- **Incorporate more data sources** to improve the depth of the analysis.
- **Include more job roles** for a broader salary comparison.
- **Automate dashboard updates** through Power Query for dynamic, real-time insights.
