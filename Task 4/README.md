## Data Cleaning & Preparation

The raw data required substantial cleaning and transformation. Below are the steps taken to prepare the dataset for analysis:

1. **Calculating Customer Ages**: Using the birth year column, I calculated the ages for accurate demographic segmentation.
   
2. **Age Group Categorization**:
   - **Teen (13-18)**, **Youth (19-35)**, **Middle-aged (36-55)**, and **Elderly (55+)**
   - Grouping by age makes it easier to identify trends in purchasing behavior across different age segments.
   
3. **Handling Missing Values**: Missing values were examined, and appropriate methods were applied to fill or remove them without losing critical information.
   
4. **Data Standardization**: I ensured uniform formats across columns, making it easier to perform accurate calculations and visualize trends.
   
5. **Removing Duplicates**: Duplicate entries were removed to maintain data integrity.

6. **Creating Calculated Columns**: Generated columns such as **Recency** (for recent purchasing activity) and **Spending Score** to quantify customer value.
