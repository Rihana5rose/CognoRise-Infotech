## Introduction
This repository contains my work as a Data Analyst intern at **CognoRise Infotech**. The project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the *Unemployment in India* dataset, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, using tools like **Excel**, **Power Query**, and **Pivot Tables**.

## Project Overview
The project aims to explore unemployment trends, employment numbers, and labor participation rates across various regions of India during and after the pandemic. The main goals include identifying regional unemployment patterns and providing insights that can help policymakers and businesses understand the employment landscape.

## Project Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Standardization**  
   - We used **Excel** and **Power Query** to clean the dataset, which involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing column names.
   - Split the `Date` column into **Month** and **Year** for easier trend analysis.

2. **Merging Datasets**  
   - Combined two datasets containing unemployment rates, employment numbers, and labor participation percentages by region and date.
   - This was done using common fields such as `Region` and `Date` in Excel.

3. **Creating Pivot Tables**  
   - Created **Pivot Tables** to derive key insights and answer the following business questions:
     - **Which regions have the highest unemployment rates?**
     - **What is the average unemployment rate across different regions over time?**
     - **How do unemployment rates vary between rural and urban areas?**

4. **Data Visualization with Dashboards**  
   - Designed an **interactive Excel dashboard** to display findings using bar charts, line charts, and sunburst charts.
   - The dashboard provides a clear overview of unemployment trends and employment numbers across regions.

5. **Key Insights**  
   - Identified the top 5 regions with the highest estimated employment numbers.
   - Highlighted specific months where unemployment rates were significantly higher due to COVID-19 lockdowns.
   - Uncovered correlations between labor participation rates and employment numbers across zones.

- **What were the unemployment trends during the pandemic?**
- **How did rural and urban unemployment rates compare?**
- **What are the labor participation rates in different regions?**

## Unemployment and COVID-19 Impact on India
The dataset highlighted the significant impact of the **COVID-19 pandemic** on the employment situation in India. Key sectors such as manufacturing, retail, and hospitality suffered greatly, causing unemployment rates to spike, particularly in urban areas.

Rural areas also experienced disruption, mainly due to disturbances in the agriculture sector and a slowdown in informal jobs. Regions like **Maharashtra**, **Delhi**, and **Tamil Nadu** faced the most significant impacts.
