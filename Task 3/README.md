## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Worked with a dataset containing 80 cereals, focusing on attributes such as sugar, fiber, protein content, and consumer ratings.
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Standardized values, handled missing data, and removed duplicates to ensure data quality for analysis.
   
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Analyzed key relationships between various nutritional factors and consumer ratings using pivot tables and visualizations.
   
4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Built a user-friendly dashboard to visualize key insights and trends for decision-making.

## Business Questions
- **Which manufacturer offers the healthiest cereals??**
- **What is the average rating for hot vs cold cereals?**
- **Which shelf location yields the highest-rated products?**
- **Which manufacturers have the highest and lowest rated cereals?**

## Key Findings
- **Health-conscious cereals** (low sugar, high fiber) generally receive higher ratings.
- **Brand loyalty** plays a significant role in high ratings, with certain brands consistently outperforming others.
- **Fiber content** appears to be a crucial factor for consumers focused on nutrition, while sugar-heavy cereals are rated lower on average.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and dashboard creation.
- **Power Query**: Used to clean and transform data efficiently for further analysis.
- **Pivot Tables**: To summarize key statistics and explore relationships between cereal attributes and ratings.

## Visualizations
- Interactive charts showing:
  - Sugar vs. fiber content correlations.
  - Ratings of cereals by nutritional content.
  - Top-rated cereals by brand and nutritional factors.
